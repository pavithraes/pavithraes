I'm Pavithra, I'm a PyData 🐍 and DevRel 🥑 enthusiast, and my pronouns are she/her. :)

Currently, I work as a Community Engagement Manager at [Coiled](https://coiled.io), where I help support 
[Dask](https://dask.org) users and contributors. I was a Data Science Evangelist at Coiled for ~1 year 
focusing on content, before moving into this role.

I also contribute to the [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) visualization library, and have worked on administrating
[Wikimedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org/)’s open source outreach programs in the past.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading a good book 📖 and some black coffee. ☕
