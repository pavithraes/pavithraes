### Hi there! 👋

I'm Pavithra, I'm a PyData 🐍 and DevRel 🥑 enthusiast, and my pronouns are she/her. :)

I'm a Developer Advocate at [Quansight](https://quansight.com/), where I work to support the PyData community.
Previously, I was a Community Engagement Manager at [Coiled](https://coiled.io), where I worked on [Dask](https://dask.org).
I also contribute to the [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) project,
and have co-administrated [Wikimedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org/)’s open source outreach programs in the past.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading a good book 📖 and some hot coffee. ☕
