I'm Pavithra, I'm a PyData 🐍 and DevRel 🥑 enthusiast, and my pronouns are she/her. :)

I work as an Open Source Developer Advocate at [Quansight](https://quansight.com/).
Previously, I was as a Community Engagement Manager at [Coiled](https://coiled.io).
I also contribute to the [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) and [Dask](https://dask.org) projects,
and have worked on administrating [Wikimedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org/)’s open source outreach programs in the past.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading a good book 📖 and some black coffee. ☕
